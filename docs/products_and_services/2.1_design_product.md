   - Analyze market needs
   - Define constraints
   - Set objectives

2. **Conceptual Design**
   - Generate concepts
   - Evaluate options
   - Select approach
   - Document decisions

3. **Detailed Design**
   - Develop specifications
   - Create drawings
   - Define components
   - Document details

4. **Prototype Development**
   - Build prototypes
   - Test functionality
   - Gather feedback
   - Refine design
